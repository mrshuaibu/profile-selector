## Overview

The Profile Project is a web application designed to allow users to select and 
display an avatar image from a set of options. Users can interact with the 
interface to choose their preferred avatar and manage the selection through 
options to save or remove the image. This project enhances user engagement by 
personalizing their experience with visual representation.

## Features

- Avatar Selection: Users can click on any avatar image from a predefined set, 
which will replace a placeholder text with the selected image.
- Dynamic Image Display: The selected avatar image is dynamically displayed in a 
designated area, updating in real-time based on user interaction.
- Remove Option: Users can remove the selected avatar and revert to a default 
state with a prompt to pick an avatar.
